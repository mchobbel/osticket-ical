1) Install the ICal library by John Grogg   (see https://github.com/u01jmg3/ics-parser)
   Under upload install, make shure you have installed it using:
   
   #  composer.phar require johngrogg/ics-parser
   
   Our plugin expects it can be loaded via upload/vendor/autoload.php 


2) Under upload : create directory 'tmp'
 # mkdir upload/tmp
 
   + Make shure osT has write-access to it.
  
3) Install ical.php in /scp/
 #  cp ical.php upload/scp/

4) Patch class.mailparser.php  (in upload/include)

 Just before you see:
   Signal::send('mail.processed', $this, $vars);
   
 add this line:
  $vars['current-mid'] = $mid;

 Nb. Our plugin needs the imap message-id ($mid) variable so we can
   find the calender imap data for the correct imap-message.
