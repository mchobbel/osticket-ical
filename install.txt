1) Install the ICal library by John Grogg   (see https://github.com/u01jmg3/ics-parser)
   Make shure you have it installed by using:
   #  composer.phar require johngrogg/ics-parser
   
2) Under upload : create directory 'tmp'
 # mkdir upload/tmp
 Plus make shure the webserver has write-access.
  
3) Install ical.php in /scp/
 #  cp ical.php upload/scp/

4) Patch class.mailparser.php
  At the moment we need 1 small change in the osTicket code for our plugin to function.
  Edit upload/include/class.mailparser.php
  
  At line 872, just before :
     Signal::send('mail.processed', $this, $vars);
   
  insert this line:
     $vars['current-mid'] = $mid;

 Nb. Our plugin needs the imap message-id ($mid) so
    it can access the IMAP-message and find
     the calender imap data.
